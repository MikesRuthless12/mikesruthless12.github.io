## Full form

### Names are used descriptively

Freally MIDI Master lets you search for an artist or producer and generate MIDI
*in the style of* their records. Those names appear solely as **descriptive
references to a recognisable musical style** — the same way a chord chart might be
labelled "bossa nova" or a drum lesson "a Bonham shuffle."

- No artist, producer, label, publisher, or rights-holder named in this software has
  endorsed, sponsored, approved, reviewed, or is affiliated with it in any way.
- No name is used as a brand, product name, or badge of origin for this software or
  for anything it generates.
- All trademarks and names are the property of their respective owners.

### What the style data actually is

Each style model in `data/` is a set of **numbers and rules** derived from published
research, music-theory analysis, interviews, public statistical datasets, and
listening notes. A model contains things like tempo ranges, swing percentages,
velocity distributions, note-density targets, hat-roll subdivision grammars, 808
slide conventions, scale and progression tendencies, and section-length templates.

A style model contains **no** copied MIDI, **no** sampled or embedded audio, **no**
transcription of any specific recording, and **no** melodic or lyrical content
extracted from any song.

### What the engine does

Generation is **100% procedural and rule-based**. The engine reads a style model,
seeds a deterministic pseudo-random generator, and constructs patterns from scratch.

- There is **no machine learning** anywhere in the product — no models, no training
  data, no inference, no neural networks of any kind.
- The engine was not trained on, and does not ingest, analyse, or reference, any
  commercial recordings, MIDI rips, or sample packs.
- There is **no feature that recreates a specific song**, and there never will be —
  this is a deliberate, permanent design decision, not a current limitation.
- Output is original by construction. A novelty guard additionally checks generated
  melodic material against a reference table of well-known hooks and rejects
  near-matches.

### Where the software runs, and what crosses a network

⛔ **The generator runs on your own machine on every surface, including the browser
one.** Freally MIDI Master is one product with four faces — the plugin, the
standalone application, the web app and the phone companion — and all four run the
same `engine` and `synth` code. The web app compiles that code to WebAssembly and
executes it in your browser; nothing is generated on a server, because there is no
server that could.

**What is fetched** is the application itself and the style data it reads — a page
has to be delivered to exist. **What is never sent** is anything you make or import:
no composition, no seed, no audio file, no project, and no information about you or
your machine. After the first visit the application and the styles you have used are
cached, so the tab generates with the network disconnected.

The plugin and the standalone application fetch nothing at all; they carry the style
data inside the binary. Collaboration is the single feature on any surface that
opens a connection, it is opt-in, and `EULA.md` § 7 describes exactly what it says
to whom.

### Style is not copyrightable; a recording is

Copyright protects a **specific fixed work** — a particular recording and a
particular composition. It does not protect a *style*, a groove, a tempo, a drum
pattern convention, or the general feel of a genre or an era. Freally MIDI Master
operates entirely in the second category, and deliberately never touches the first.

This is a description of the software's design, **not legal advice**. You remain
responsible for the finished music you release — see `EULA.md` § 3.

### If you are a named artist, producer, or rights-holder

If you would prefer your name not appear in the roster, contact
**freallyproducts@gmail.com** and it will be removed. Removing a name does not require
a legal claim, a lawyer, or an explanation — just ask. Style models are data files;
removal is a one-line change and ships in the next dataset update.

### Attribution

Public datasets and research that contributed statistical parameters to the style
models are credited in `docs/credits.md` and in the About screen.
