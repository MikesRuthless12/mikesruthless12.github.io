# Dataset Protocol

*How a style model gets written, checked and shipped. Phase 5 encodes 50 genre
archetypes and 500+ artists against this document; anything that disagrees with
it is a bug in one of the two.*

Read `docs/style-research.md` § Methodology first — its five hard rules are the
boundary this protocol works inside, and nothing here relaxes them.

---

## 1. What you are writing

A style model is **a set of numbers and rules describing tendencies**. It is not
a transcription, it contains no note data, and it never will. The schema says so
in its own description (`data/schema/artist-style.schema.json`), and the reason
is in `docs/legal/disclaimer.md`.

The line, stated once so it does not have to be re-derived per artist:

| Encode freely | Never encode |
|---|---|
| BPM ranges and centres of gravity | A specific song's melody, in any form |
| Swing amounts, microtiming offsets, velocity bands | Note data lifted from a MIDI file |
| Chord-progression *families* as Roman numerals | A named song's exact progression, presented as that song's |
| Drum grammars — densities, anchors, syncopation rates | Anything from a commercial MIDI pack |
| Register, contour, interval and density distributions | Anything from BitMidi/FreeMidi-class scrapes |
| Timbre *hints* — "detuned piano", "supersaw" | Samples, audio, or artist logos/images |

A Roman-numeral family like `i–VI–III–VII` is a commonplace building block and
unprotectable (Skidmore v. Led Zeppelin, 9th Cir. en banc 2020). A contour rule
that says "descends, 2-bar cell, repeats" is a tendency. Neither is a melody.

**Statistical sources are limited to the four in research ch. 5 § A** — GMD and
E-GMD (CC-BY 4.0, attribution required, see `docs/legal/attributions.md`),
McGill Billboard (CC0), Lakh aggregate statistics only, and Hooktheory trends
aggregates within its terms. MetaMIDI, GigaMIDI and MAESTRO are non-commercial
and must not be touched.

### Which folder a model goes in

⛔⛔ **Three folders, and the split between the first two is not cosmetic**
(2026-08-12). Mike: *"just put the producers only in there instead of having
artists and producers all in one folder, so that way i know who is who and so
does anyone else looking at my code"*, and then *"ensure that when you add
volumes within the code for the tasks in the roadmap that it splits it into
those 2 separate folders."*

| folder | `"type"` | what lives there |
|---|---|---|
| `data/artists/` | `"artist"` | someone who fronts the record |
| `data/producers/` | `"producer"` | someone who makes it |
| `data/genres/` | `"genre"` | the archetype an artist or producer extends |

**The folder and the `type` field must agree**, and
`every_model_sits_in_the_folder_its_type_names` in `engine/tests/dataset.rs`
fails the build when they do not. Two records of one fact is a drift risk taken
on deliberately: `files::scan` recurses and throws the path away before the
loader ever sees it, so the *folder* is invisible at runtime and the *field* is
invisible to a person reading the repo. Neither can be dropped, so they are made
to agree instead.

▶ **Which is which is not a judgement call — it is already written down.** Every
volume of `docs/style-research-extended*.md` splits each genre's entries under
`### ARTISTS` and `### PRODUCERS` headings. Encode from those sections; do not
re-decide. The one exception on record is the ten flagships that predate volume
1 and appear in no volume — Metro Boomin, Southside and Pi'erre Bourne were
filed as producers, the other seven as artists.

⚠ **Anything reading one folder is a bug waiting for the next volume.** The
split broke nothing at load time and silently halved two things that read
`data/artists` directly: `scripts/roster-ledger.mjs`, which would have gone on
describing 344 of 534 models and calling it the roster, and
`the_first_genre_an_artist_works_in_is_the_one_it_is_built_from`, which would
have stopped covering 190 of them. Both now read `STYLE_DIRS`/`styleDirs`.

## 2. The encoding checklist

Eleven steps, in this order. Skipping one is how a model ends up plausible and
wrong.

### 1. Identify the lane

Which scene archetype does this artist actually work in? Research ch. 4 §
"Scene taxonomy" names eleven lanes for the underground; ch. 1–3 cover the
mainstream by genre. The lane is a musical claim, not a marketing one — Glokk40Spazz
is dark plugg out of Decatur, not Memphis, whatever the sonic influence says.

If the artist genuinely straddles two lanes, pick the one their **drums** come
from. Drums are what `extends` inherits most of, and what the roster's
distinctness test compares.

### 2. Pick `extends`

```json
"extends": ["dark-plugg"]
```

Ordered parents; later entries win over earlier ones, and the model itself wins
over all of them. Three rules:

- **A model may only extend what it is musically built from.** Extending `trap`
  because it is convenient makes every unstated field wrong, not absent.
- **The first entry is normally the artist's home genre**, and is normally also
  the first entry in `relatedGenres`.
- **Arrays replace, they do not append.** An artist that authors its own `modes`
  replaces its genre's rather than adding to them. That is deliberate — it keeps
  an artist's moods to the ones that artist actually does — but it means a
  partial `modes` array silently drops the rest.

### 3. Set the `session` block

BPM min/max/**mode**, `halfTime`, keys, scales, swing, humanize.

`mode` is the centre of gravity and matters as much as the bounds. A range of
130–160 with a mode of 152 is a different artist from the same range with a mode
of 136.

Swing lives on the MPC scale: `0.50` straight, `0.54` subtle (modern hip-hop and
R&B), `0.58` classic MPC boom bap, `0.62` heavy shuffle (neo-soul), `0.667` full
triplet. The lint rejects anything outside 0.50–0.75 because outside that range
it is almost always a typo.

### 4–8. The part deltas: drums, chords, melody, countermelody, bassline

**Author deltas, not copies.** Every field you restate at the same value as the
parent is a field that will not track the parent when the parent is corrected.
Write only what makes this artist *not* their genre.

The five questions worth answering explicitly, because they are what listeners
actually hear:

- **Drums** — what is the kick doing off the grid, and is the 808 a bassline or
  its own counter-riff? `bass808.role` is the single highest-leverage field in
  the schema.
- **Chords** — how many, how often do they change, and how coloured? `extensions`
  (triad/seventh/ninth) is what separates pluggnb from plugg in one line.

  ⛔ **A numeral names a degree, never a chord quality.** The parser accepts an
  optional `b`/`#`, roman letters in one case, and an optional `dim` — so `i`,
  `VI`, `bII` and `vii°` are numerals and **`i7`, `iv7` and `IIImaj7` are not**.
  Research ch. 2 writes families as `i7–iv7–VII7–IIImaj7` because that is how a
  musician writes them; the *model* writes `["i","iv","VII","III"]` and puts the
  sevenths in `extensions`. A numeral the parser cannot read is **dropped
  silently** — the chord simply never sounds — which is why
  `engine/tests/chords.rs` fails the build on one. Ask it, do not eyeball it.
- **Melody** — register, phrase length, density, contour, and `timbreHint`.
- **Countermelody** — `densityRatio` and whether it answers or sustains.
- **Bassline** — does it follow the roots, or is it independent?

### 9. Arrangement

`sectionBars`, `structures`, `transitions`. This is the block most often left
inherited, and it is the one that makes Song Mode sound like the artist rather
than like the app. A pop model whose chorus does not land inside 60 seconds is
not a pop model.

### 10. Aliases, tier, confidence, sources

**Aliases are how the artist gets found**, and they must include the spellings
producers actually type — Discord channel names, nicknames, and the two or three
obvious misspellings. `"ye"` for Kanye West, `"osama son"` for OsamaSon,
`"x"` for XXXTENTACION. Aliases are lowercase and never duplicated across models;
see § 5.

`confidence` is `high` / `medium` / `low`, and **a `low` model must say why in
`notes`**. `sources` cites where the parameters came from, in the compressed form
the shipped models already use — `"style-research ch.4 OsamaSon"`.

### 11. Two checks: the compiler, then the ear

```sh
npm run dataset:validate     # schema + lints + inheritance + cross-references
npm run dataset:stats        # counts, and who is missing sources
npm run dataset:coverage     # what each model declares vs inherits
```

Then the **invariant listen test**: generate on several seeds and ask whether it
is recognisably this artist and not their genre. The suite asserts the mechanical
half of that (`engine/tests/genre_invariants.rs`), but a model can pass every
assertion and still be a name with numbers attached. That is what the ear is for.

---

## 3. Quality bars per tier

`tier` is a claim about depth, and the roster's ranking uses it. Three values:

| Tier | Blocks it must declare | Distinctness bar | Sources |
|---|---|---|---|
| **flagship** | `session` + all five parts + `arrangement`, and normally `modes` | Blind A/B against its genre parent **and** against the nearest flagship in the same lane must be audibly different | Named research entry, `confidence: high` |
| **standard** | `session` + `drums` + at least two melodic blocks | Differs from its genre parent on every seed | Named research entry or a documented convention |
| **inherited** | `session` + `drums` deltas, plus aliases | Differs from its genre parent on every seed | May cite the era-genre archetype it sits on |

Every tier, without exception:

- **Passes `datasetc validate`.** This is the CI gate; there is no local override.
- **Generates distinct drums from every other shipped model.** Enforced by
  `no_two_genres_produce_the_same_drums`, which compares every pair in the roster
  — so an inherited-tier model whose only overrides are BPM and keys will fail,
  because neither reaches the drum generator. Give it at least one drum delta
  that is true of the artist.
- **Differs from its parent on all 20 seeds**, enforced by
  `every_flagship_artist_sounds_unlike_the_genre_it_extends` (which, despite the
  name, checks every artist).
- **Cites sources.** `datasetc stats` lists unsourced models by name.

Genre archetypes carry one further bar: **each needs a signature invariant test**
in `engine/tests/genre_invariants.rs`, and the guard test
`every_genre_in_the_roster_has_an_invariant_test` fails the build if you add a
genre without one. The test asserts the thing that makes it that genre — the
claim, sourced, checked over 100 seeds, because a genre is a distribution rather
than a pattern.

---

## 4. Batch workflow

Dataset work is batched because the checks are cheap per batch and expensive per
file. One batch is 15–25 models in a single lane or era.

1. **Read the research for the whole batch first.** Encoding artists one at a
   time produces a batch that agrees with itself only by accident; reading the
   lane first is what makes the deltas relative to each other.
2. **Write the models.** Deltas only, per § 2.
3. **`npm run dataset:validate`.** Fix everything before moving on — a batch with
   one failure is a batch nobody can check the rest of.
4. **`cargo test -p engine`** — distinctness, invariants, and the generator
   suites. This is where "two artists in the same lane came out identical" shows
   up.
5. **`npm run dataset:coverage`** and read the column for the batch. A row of
   `○` where you expected `●` means the deltas did not land where you thought.
6. **Listen.** Flagship tier: every model. Standard: every model. Inherited:
   a 10% sample per sub-batch, chosen across lanes rather than alphabetically.
7. **Record the batch in the roster ledger** (§ 6) and commit as one change.

---

## 5. Aliases and search

The roster is searched with `src/lib/fuzzy.ts`, over names and aliases, and
ranked with tier as a weight. Three rules that stop a 500-model roster from
becoming unsearchable:

- **No alias may resolve to two models.** Collisions are a defect, not a
  ranking problem — if `"x"` matches both XXXTENTACION and an artist literally
  named X, one of them must give it up.
- **Aliases are lowercase, punctuation-free, and never a substring the fuzzy
  matcher would find anyway.** `"metro"` earns its place because the model is
  named "Metro Boomin"; `"metro boomin"` does not.
- **Spell it how the channel spells it.** The single most common way a search
  fails is that the roster carries the label-correct spelling and the user typed
  the Discord one.

---

## 6. Roster ledger

The ledger is the record of what was encoded against which archetype — the thing
that makes "is this artist already in?" answerable without listing 500 files. It
lives in Appendix A of this document, one row per artist: id, display name,
tier, confidence and alias count, **grouped by lane** rather than alphabetically,
because lane balance is what is worth seeing at a glance. A roster with 200 trap
artists and three country ones has a hole in it, and an alphabetical list hides
that completely.

<!-- ROSTER-LEDGER:BEGIN -->
**1250 models** — 802 artists and 448 producers; 321 flagship, 929 standard, 0 inherited, across 31 lanes.

## 7. Regenerating the ledger

```sh
node scripts/roster-ledger.mjs         # rewrite Appendix A in place
node scripts/roster-ledger.mjs --check # fail if it is stale (the CI gate)
```

The ledger is derived, so it is regenerated rather than maintained. `--check` is
what stops it drifting from `data/`.

---

## 8. The novelty table

`engine/data/novelty/hooks.hash` is the reference table the novelty guard (FR-011,
TASK-039) screens every generated melody against. This section is the documented
process the task asks for: what the file is, how it is rebuilt, and why its
inputs are not in this repo.

### What is in the file, and what is deliberately not

**Hashes, and nothing else.** Each line is one `0x`-prefixed 64-bit fingerprint
of a *contour* — a run of `(interval, onset-gap)` steps — and there is no way
back from one to a note. Nothing in the file names a pitch, a key, a tempo or a
title. That is the whole point: the table has to ship inside a product that must
never carry somebody else's notes.

**A fingerprint is transposition- and articulation-blind by construction.** The
interval side is the semitone step between consecutive notes, so a hook moved to
another key fingerprints identically. The rhythm side is the *gap between
onsets*, not the note's length, so the same line played staccato and legato
fingerprints identically — and a humanised 478-tick eighth quantises onto the
same rung as an exact 480, which is what lets the guard run before or after the
humanizer and get the same answer.

Each melody contributes hashes at **both** widths the guard looks up: `n = 8`,
the screen every take must pass, and `n = 12`, the loosened screen it falls back
to after four refusals. A lookup at one width can only ever find a hash written
at that width.

### The contour listing format

One melody per file, `*.contour`, so an n-gram can never straddle two of them
and fingerprint a phrase nobody wrote. A file is whitespace-separated tokens:

```
<interval>:<note value>
```

- **`<interval>`** — semitones from the previous note, signed (`+2`, `-5`, `0`).
  Clamped to ±24, because a two-octave leap and a three-octave one are the same
  event to a contour.
- **`<note value>`** — the gap to the next note, spelled the way the rest of the
  dataset spells a note value: `4`, `8`, `8th`, `16`, `16T`, `1/8`. It is read by
  `grid::note_value_ticks`, not by a second parser.
- `#` starts a comment. Newlines are whitespace — break a listing across lines
  by phrase, it makes no difference to the output.

A melody of *k* notes is *k − 1* tokens. ⚠ **The ladder has no dotted values**,
so a dotted quarter is written as the rung it quantises to (`2`). That coarsens
the screen, which errs towards catching more than it should rather than less —
the safe direction for a guard whose bad outcome is letting a known hook
through.

### Rebuilding the table

```sh
cargo run -p datasetc -- novelty <contours>/ > engine/data/novelty/hooks.hash
```

The command prints one line per listing with its step count, then the totals, to
stderr; the table itself goes to stdout. It **fails rather than skips** on a
listing it cannot read, because a mistyped note value would otherwise cost that
melody its entry in silence.

Then re-add the file's header comment — the command emits hashes only — or copy
it from the previous version.

### ⛔ Why the contour listings are not in this repo

FR-011's rule is "hashes, not note data", and a contour listing *is* note data
with the key filed off: transposition-invariant, but still a melody. So the
listings are an **input**, authored at research time from public melodic-contour
listings, and never committed. What is committed is the irreversible output.

That has a cost worth naming: rebuilding the table means re-deriving the
contours, not re-running a script over checked-in files. The list below is what
makes that possible.

### What the shipped table was built from

**47 public-domain melodies — 846 steps, 834 distinct hashes** across both
widths. ⚠ **This grew from a 7-melody, 104-hash starter set on 2026-09-04**
(TASK-039); the starter set is the first seven rows below and every one of them
is still in here.

A melody shorter than 12 steps contributes at the tight width only, and one of
exactly 8 contributes a single hash; that is correct rather than a shortfall.

⚠ **The 2026-09-04 listings were re-derived, not recovered, and six hashes
moved.** The originals were never committed (see below), so the seven starter
melodies were transcribed again. Five reproduced their shipped hashes exactly.
Two did not, and were **solved** rather than guessed — fixing the intervals,
which are not in doubt, and searching the duration spellings for the one whose
hashes were already in the shipped table: Jingle Bells turned out to be plain
quarters rather than the dotted-quarter-and-eighth a lead sheet prints, and Für
Elise's opening figure was sixteenths rather than eighths. **London Bridge did
not solve**, so its 6 shipped hashes are gone and 6 of this transcription's
stand in their place. The melody is still screened; only the spelling of its
rhythm differs. ▶ The lesson is the one this section already states from the
other side: an uncommitted input means a rebuild is a re-derivation, and a
re-derivation is not bit-identical.

### ⛔ What this screen can and cannot cover — read before relying on it

⛔⛔ **Every melody above is public domain, and that is a permanent property of
this table rather than a stage it will grow out of.** A commercial hook cannot
enter it: putting one in means deriving its contour, a contour listing *is* note
data, and § 8's whole rule is that this product never holds somebody else's
notes. There is no version of this file that screens against a chart record.

▶ **So the guard catches an accidental quotation of a *well-known* melody** — a
generated hook that turns out to be Ode to Joy — and that is a real, worthwhile
thing to catch, because it is embarrassing whether or not it is actionable.

⛔ **It is NOT the product's defence against a copyright claim, and must never be
described as one.** That defence is three other things, all of which already
hold: generation is procedural from hand-authored style parameters with no
recording anywhere in the chain; a style model is numbers and rules, and musical
style is not protectable; and FMM-M12 writes a provenance receipt beside every
export naming the model, the seed and the macros, which is per-export evidence of
independent creation. `docs/legal/disclaimer.md` is the statement of all three,
and its wording — *"a novelty guard **additionally** checks"* — is deliberately
subordinate. Keep it that way.

⚠ **Three further limits, so nobody over-reads the mechanism:** the screen covers
melody, countermelody and a bassline only when that bassline places its own
onsets (`screens`); drums and chords are never screened; and a hit needs eight
consecutive intervals *and* eight consecutive duration classes to match.

### The gates on it

- `the_bundled_table_parses_and_is_not_empty` (`engine/src/novelty.rs`) — the
  table is compiled in with `include_str!`, and a malformed one degrades to an
  empty table rather than panicking inside a DAW. This test is what makes that
  degraded path unreachable.
- `the_shipped_roster_walks_past_the_bundled_table` (`engine/tests/novelty.rs`)
  — every shipped model, both screened parts, five seeds. ⛔ A failure here is
  **news, not necessarily a bug**: it means a shipped artist's melody collides
  with a reference contour, and without the test every generation of that artist
  would silently be a retry.
- `screening_costs_less_than_the_five_millisecond_budget` — FR-011's stated
  overhead.

### Changing the fingerprint

`SCHEME` in `engine/src/novelty.rs` is mixed into every hash. **Bump it whenever
a step's meaning changes** — the ladder, the clamp, the choice of onset gap over
note length — and rebuild the table. Without that the two schemes share a number
space, and a stale table goes on matching things it never described.
